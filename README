======================
    OVERVIEW
======================

word-wrap is a filter program that word-wraps text you wish to output onto your terminal screen.

======================
    INSTRUCTIONS
======================

word-wrap reads text from stdin and outputs the formatted version to your terminal screen. If you redirect stdout to a file, the output may not appear exactly as it would on your terminal screen.

For more detailed instructions, call "word-wrap -h".

Examples:
    word-wrap < README
    cat README | word-wrap -w 80
